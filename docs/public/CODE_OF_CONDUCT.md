# MixClick Code Of Conduct

As a small side project, we must maintain professionalism and handle everything with care as if we were a big team. Please read through **ALL** information to make sure you follow the rules.

## 1.0 Your Rights

> As a strong believer in your rights as an individual, you will have rights that empower you. However, with great power comes great responsibility. With that disclaimer out of the way, let's begin!

### 1.1 Communication and Collaboration

(i) You have the right to engage in discussions and express your ideas in a professional and constructive manner.

(ii) You have the right to ask for clarification, support, and feedback from other team members. We believe in an open environment where no question is a bad question.

(iii) You have the right to challenge ideas and proposals with valid reasoning and data, without fear of retaliation.

### 1.2 Privacy

(i) You have the right to your privacy. Personal information shared within the team will not be disclosed to external parties without your explicit consent.

### 1.3 Project Forking and Creative Freedom

(i) **You always have the right to fork the project.** As a collaborative, open-source project, you have the perpetual and unconditional right to create an independent version of this project at any time. This means you can take the codebase and all its assets and continue its development under a different name and direction.

(ii) You are free to pursue your own vision and implement features as you see fit in a forked version, as long as you respect the original project's licensing and provide proper attribution.

(iii) The MixClick project will always remain a separate entity from any forked versions, and we will not be responsible for their maintenance, direction, or content.

## 2.0 Your Responsibilities & Limitations

With these rights come specific responsibilities to ensure our team remains a productive and respectful environment.

### 2.1 Professional Conduct

(i) **Respectful Communication:** You must communicate with others in a professional, empathetic, and respectful manner, regardless of their background, experience, or role. Avoid personal attacks, insults, or demeaning language.

(ii) **Constructive Criticism:** All feedback and criticism should be constructive. Focus on the idea or the work, not the person. When providing feedback, be prepared to offer suggestions for improvement.

(iii) **Zero Tolerance for Harassment:** We have a zero-tolerance policy for harassment in any form. This includes, but is not limited to, offensive comments, intimidation, unwanted sexual attention, or any behavior that creates a hostile environment.

### 2.2 Intellectual Property

(i) **Copyright and Licensing:** You must respect the copyrights and licenses of all external materials used in the project. This includes code, images, and other assets.
